This script is a follow up to the analysis of technical variables for the gene expression data. 

### The impact of when the samples were collected (relative to time of death)

There was a concern that "Hours post-mortem" were confounded by species. For example, according to the documentation that we received from the different sites, the rhesus macaque samples were collected earlier than the chimpanzee samples and the chimpanzee samples were collected earlier than humans. These differences could impact the quality of the RNA. We can look at RIN score as a proxy for RNA quality. Therefore, we will look to see if there are differences in RIN score 

Note: RIN score is missing for H4Lu
